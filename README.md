# BICrimePredictionWithPython
For this project, weâ€™ve suggested a BI solution to overcome the increasing rate of crimes in United States. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is domestically facing the increasing crime rate all over the U.S. Being as a principal federal law enforcement agency, this BI solution that will provide a classified solution for prediction of crimes to FBI. The rationale of selecting FBI to present this solution is that is the counterterrorism, criminal investigation, and counter-intelligence organization, which has jurisdiction over a huge number of categorical federal crimes violations.
