# BICrimePredictionWithPython
For this project, weâ€™ve suggested a BI solution to overcome the increasing rate of crimes in United States. The rationale for selecting law enforcement organizations to present this solution is that business intelligence insights can help organizations better anticipate the occurrence of future crimes and enhance their response rate. The overall analysis will involve the use of the ARIMA model in order to derive conclusions from past collected data.
